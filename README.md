# Gene regulatory network inference based on scRNA-sequencing data

This repository/folder contains the computational pipeline of the GRN-inference analysis based on expression of single cells. The aim of this project is to include single-cell omics analysis and use it to have models tailored to single-cell datasets. The final goal is to have single-cell models that allow for heterogeneous multiscale simulations. Single-cell data analysis is not trivial as these datasets are typically much more sparse and noisier than bulk data.
